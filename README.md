#Augumentedreality
Here I am presenting the Project which is based on creating an AR Application using Unity and Blender. 

What does this Application will do?

The Application will take the 2-Dimensional image with the help of AR camera as its input and give the output of the system in 3-Dimensional view or 3D model.


What's the need of this Application?

This app will be helpful to the students to learn some of the concepts of Computer Network(CN) in the 6th semester of Information technology students in RTMNU. This app will give the 3D model of the images ,so that students can easily understand the concept behind the diagrams.


Why it is required?

Usually students donâ€™t understand the concept behind the diagram they just learn the diagram
just to pass the exams, but with the help of this  application  students can actually visualize the things in 3D and can get into core concept of it, and can understand the concept and working of the model, since they can visualize it, and the visual things will be remembered to the students.
